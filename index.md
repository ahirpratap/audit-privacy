**Effective Date:** July 13, 2025  
**Last Updated:** July 13, 2025

Thank you for using **AuditEase**, a mobile application designed for internal auditing and compliance management. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information within the AuditEase application.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

AuditEase is built for internal business use. We may collect the following types of information:

- **User Role Selection:** Selected role (Admin, Auditor, Viewer) is used locally and is not sent to a server.
- **Audit Data:** Ratings, checkbox responses, comments, and image attachments submitted through the audit form.
- **Device Information:** Limited device information (such as OS version) may be used for troubleshooting.
- **Photos and Camera Access (if enabled):** Used to capture audit evidence only. These images are stored locally unless manually exported.

> We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) unless explicitly entered by the user.

---

## 2. How We Use the Information

All data collected is used **strictly for internal audit tracking and compliance purposes**. Specifically, we use this data to:

- Store audit records locally on the device
- Allow auditors to complete multi-step forms
- View past audit history
- Export audit reports if needed

---

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage:** Audit data is stored securely on your device using local storage mechanisms (e.g., AsyncStorage or SQLite).
- **No Cloud Sync:** AuditEase does not upload any audit data to external servers unless a custom backend is integrated by your organization.
- **Security:** We implement standard device-level security practices to protect your data. However, since the app runs locally, we recommend keeping your device secured via passcode or biometric authentication.

---

## 4. Permissions

AuditEase may request the following permissions:

- **Camera and Media Access:** To allow auditors to take photos during audits.
- **Storage Access:** To save audit files or attachments.
- **Internet Access (optional):** If using WebView to view documentation or links.

---

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

- **We do not sell or share your data** with third parties.
- Data may only be exported or shared manually by the device user or organization administrator.

---

## 6. Your Rights

Since AuditEase does not store or process data on external servers, any data deletion or modification must be handled manually by the user or administrator on the device.

---

## 7. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes means you agree to the updated terms.
